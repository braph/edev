TODO [most important first]
  - lib/packedvector.hpp:
    - is a complete mess
    - add tests (including performance tests!)

  - playlist:
    ^S for saving?

  - IDK if I miunderstood the iterator interface in general or my GenericIterator implementation
    is flawed. vector.begin() + N  gave some strange results.

MAYBE
  - Create a "StringScan" class that replaces sscanf() and use it in browsepage.cpp
    [try_]{read,peek,search,skip,eat}_[span_]{re,str,char,char_of}
    seek_to, seek_beyond, seek_before...

  - Instead of having multiple settings for each terminal setup (MONO/8/256 - infoline.format_top/infoline.format_top_256)
    we could only use the setting for 256 colors and deduce the setting for 8-bit terminals

  - config.cpp:
    - expand_path(): maybe include a $TEMP?

  - xml.hpp:
    messy code... iterators?!

  - keybindings:
    ^R/F5 for reloading the browser after a database update has been done

NOTES
  - I observed that the `constexpr` qualifier increases the binary size
  - Is there a `return value optimization` in a class initializer list?
  - private -> protected
  - wtf xml.hpp that optimization did'nt work?!

// @bindings[:playlist]
//   :'playlist.toggle_selection' => ['^v'  ]
//   :'playlist.reload'           => [?r    ]
