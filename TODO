- Config: Themes set()
- Make the Result class a Generic. Do std::sort() etc, by providing lambdas
- keybindings: ^R, maybe even F5 for reloading, ^S for saving?
- pads: fix mouse offset // ui.hpp mincol etc...
- noexcept on noutrefresh etc.
- vol. 3 ?

===============================================================================

- Make actions a pImpl? --- seems not yet to be needed....
- database.cpp
  - Lots of duplicated code in class:Table. Maybe use class TableBase + Table<T>?
- application.cpp
  - Preload playlist
  - What to do when the database has updated?
- downloads.cpp
  - Maybe add a --tries option to the Download base class?!
  - Micro optimiation: Preallocate buffer for downloads (50*1024 for BrowsePage src)
- Add views/browser.cpp
    if (selection)
      color = UI::Colors.get("list.item_selection");
    else if (index % 2 == 0)
      color = UI::Colors.get("list.item_even");
    else
      color = UI::Colors.get("list.item_odd");
