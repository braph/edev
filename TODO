TODO [most important first]
  - lib/packedvector.hpp:
    - is a complete mess
    - add tests (including performance tests!)
    - maybe rename `__enter__` and `__leave__`

  - lib/bit_tools.hpp:
    - not portable yet (check if __builtin_clz is available and provide alternatives)
    - replace_bits/extract_bits... 

  - Add a browser view

  - browsepage.cpp / updater.cpp:
    Ensure that exceptions will be logged instead of terminating the program

  - trackloader.cpp:
    - Exceptions? Are they logged yet?!

  - playlist:
    ^S for saving?

  - database.cpp: track_column_to_string ???

  - Add filenames to error messages (WHICH FILES?!)

MAYBE
  - Create a "StringScan" class that replaces sscanf() and use it in browsepage.cpp
    [try_]{read,peek,search,skip,eat}_[span_]{re,str,char,char_of}
    seek_to, seek_beyond, seek_before...

  - Instead of having multiple settings for each terminal setup (MONO/8/256 - infoline.format_top/infoline.format_top_256)
    we could only use the setting for 256 colors and deduce the setting for 8-bit terminals

  - config.cpp:
    - expand_path(): maybe include a $TEMP?

  - xml.hpp:
    messy code... iterators?!

  - keybindings:
    ^R/F5 for reloading the browser after a database update has been done

  - lib/cstring.hpp
    - add starts_with and other functions?

  - strinkchunk: drop CString?


NOTES
  - I observed that the `constexpr` qualifier increases the binary size
  - Is there a `return value optimization` in a class initializer list?
  - private -> protected
  - wtf xml.hpp that optimization did'nt work?!
